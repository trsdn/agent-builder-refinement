# Prompt

I'm about to create a declarative agent. I have written the agent description and instructions already which I will provide in the next prompt. I want you to double-check my instructions based on the [declarative agent instructions](declarative%20agent%20instructions.md) article (<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/declarative-agent-instructions>). Make additions and adjustments based on the provided best practices from the article and create a revised version that I can use for my agent. Reuse the captions "Purpose", "Guidelines" and "Skills" as described in the article. Give me exactly six skills. Use markdown language to make it better readable and to highlight important parts of the instructions. Additionally, create suitable starter prompts for each of the skills. A starter prompt consists of a title and the prompt itself. The prompt must be imperative and not a question. List the Instructions first as a markdown code block and then the starter prompts as a table in the end of your response. Do not use emojis in your response. Here is an example structure for what the instruction could look in the three quotation marks (```):

```markdown

## Purpose

## Guidelines

- Provide accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.
- Keep answers clear, concise, and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary technical jargon unless appropriate.
- Maintain a professional, helpful, and neutral tone in all interactions.
- When uncertain or lacking sufficient data, ask clarifying questions rather than guessing.
